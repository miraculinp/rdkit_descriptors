RDKit Molecular Descriptor Calculation - README
This script demonstrates how to calculate molecular descriptors using RDKit, a powerful cheminformatics toolkit. The code takes SMILES strings from a CSV file, generates molecular objects, and computes various molecular descriptors for each molecule.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have rdkit installed. You can install it using the following command:

Copy code
!pip install rdkit
Script Overview
1. Importing Required Libraries
pandas: For data handling.
rdkit: RDKit modules for handling molecules and calculating descriptors.
warnings: To suppress unnecessary warnings.
2. Loading the Dataset
The dataset (PDE4AKI.csv) is loaded using pandas. It is expected to contain at least one column with SMILES strings of molecules.
3. Generating Molecular Objects
SMILES strings are converted into RDKit molecular objects using Chem.MolFromSmiles().
Hydrogen atoms are added to the molecules using Chem.AddHs().
4. Visualizing Molecules
The first few molecules from the dataset are displayed as images using Draw.MolsToGridImage() for visual inspection.
5. Calculating Molecular Descriptors
Single Molecule Descriptors: A single molecular descriptor (RingCount) is calculated for a specific molecule using MolecularDescriptorCalculator().
Multiple Descriptors for All Molecules: A full set of molecular descriptors is computed for all molecules in the dataset. The descriptors are listed in Descriptors._descList.
6. Generating Descriptor DataFrame
Descriptors for all molecules are calculated and stored in a new DataFrame.
The original dataset is updated with the calculated descriptors by concatenating both DataFrames.
7. Exporting the Results
The modified dataset, including all descriptors, is exported to a new CSV file (PDE4AKI_descriptors.csv).
Key Functions and Modules
Chem.MolFromSmiles(): Converts a SMILES string to a molecular object.
Chem.AddHs(): Adds hydrogen atoms to a molecule.
MoleculeDescriptors.MolecularDescriptorCalculator(): Calculates molecular descriptors for a given molecule.
Draw.MolsToGridImage(): Generates an image grid of molecules for visualization.
Descriptors._descList: List of all available molecular descriptors in RDKit.
Output
The script outputs a CSV file (PDE4AKI_descriptors.csv) with all the molecular descriptors for the molecules in the dataset, excluding the molecular objects.
How to Run
Install rdkit and other necessary libraries.
Make sure the PDE4AKI.csv file is available in the specified path.
Run the script to compute and export molecular descriptors.
